# Convolution-model-Step-by-Step-v1

In this notebook, we will implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and backward propagation.

At the end of this, we will have learnt to  implemented all the building blocks of a neural network as we understand how convolutional neural networks works behind the scenes
